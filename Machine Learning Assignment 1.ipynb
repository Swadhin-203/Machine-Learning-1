    "# Q6-What is train, test, validation split?Explain the importance of each term?\n",
    "Ans: Train, test, validation split is a common technique used in machine learning to evaluate the performance of a model on new, unseen data. The technique involves dividing the dataset into three parts: the training set, the validation set, and the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Training set: The training set is used to train the model. The model learns the patterns, structures, and relationships in the data by minimizing the error between the predicted and actual output on the training data. The model is optimized on the training data to achieve the best possible performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Validation set: The validation set is used to evaluate the performance of the model during the training process. The model is evaluated on the validation data after each epoch or iteration to check if it is overfitting or underfitting. Overfitting occurs when the model performs well on the training data but poorly on the validation data, while underfitting occurs when the model performs poorly on both the training and validation data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Test set: The test set is used to evaluate the final performance of the model. The model is evaluated on the test data to check how well it generalizes to new, unseen data. The test data should be representative of the real-world data that the model is intended to work on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The importance of each term can be summarized as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Training set: The training set is essential for building the model. The model learns from the training data to make accurate predictions on new, unseen data.\n",

    "# Q7-How can Unsupervised Learning can be used in anomaly detection?\n",
    "Ans:Unsupervised learning can be used in anomaly detection by identifying patterns and structures in the data that are different from the normal behavior. Anomalies are rare events that deviate from the expected behavior of the system, and they can be caused by errors, fraud, cyber attacks, or other unusual events.\n",
    "\n",
    "One common approach to anomaly detection using unsupervised learning is to use clustering algorithms such as k-means or hierarchical clustering. These algorithms group similar data points together based on their proximity in the feature space. Anomalies are then identified as data points that do not belong to any cluster or belong to a small, isolated cluster. The distance or dissimilarity measure used in the clustering algorithm can be adjusted to make it more sensitive to anomalies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another approach to anomaly detection using unsupervised learning is to use dimensionality reduction algorithms such as PCA (Principal Component Analysis) or t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding). These algorithms reduce the high-dimensional data to a lower-dimensional space while preserving the most important information. Anomalies are then identified as data points that are far away from the normal data in the lower-dimensional space."
